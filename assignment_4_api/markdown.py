# Hello and welcome to my 4th CFG Project.
# The following scripts will provide some guidance to using the api I have created.

# Firstly, open and run the sql script names 'assignment_4_sql_script' in MYSQL Workbench.
# Now, you should have a database in your schema named 'theatre'
# Next, open  the 'config1.py' and fill in your MYSQL details.

#Once you have successfully completed the above you should be able to run the python files 'utils.py', 'root.py' and 'client.py' (in that order).
# Now you can interact with the database and the live url.

#Thank you!
